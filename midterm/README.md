midterm code

After the mid term, I test my submitted code on the leetcode

About the code of question 1, it only pass the the test case given in example 1 && 2, not pass all the test case on the leetcode

About the question 2, if you could 
1 change my first method's return type from   int   into  ListNode
2 change my first method's return  value  from  sum  into  dummy.next 
3 add    return;   on line 23 after the parentheses
it will pass all the test code on the leetcode;
somehow, I misunderstand the return type of the question 2 

About the question 3 and question 4, they pass all the test code on the leetcode;

I already try my best, but the result is not ideal for me

I don't know, maybe I should work harder
